# Library Management System

This project is a library management page that allows users to explore a collection of books, sign up or log in, view book availability, and rent books by adding them to a cart. It aims to provide an aesthetically pleasing user interface and a seamless user experience. The project utilizes ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

## Features

### 1. Loading Animation
The page incorporates an optimized and visually appealing loading animation. It ensures that users have a pleasant experience while waiting for the content to load.

### 2. User Signup and Login
Users can create a new account by signing up with their details. Existing users can log in using their credentials. This feature enables personalized access to the library's services and functionalities.

### 3. Book Listing
The library management page displays a comprehensive list of books available in the collection. Users can browse through the titles, authors, and other relevant information about each book. This feature provides an overview of the available books and facilitates easy book selection.

### 4. Book Availability
Each book in the collection is marked with an exclusive indicator to denote its availability. Users can quickly identify if a book is available for rent or if all copies are currently rented out. Additionally, the number of copies available is displayed alongside the book information, allowing users to make informed decisions.

### 5. Cart Functionality
Users can add books to their cart, creating a temporary collection of books they intend to rent. The cart feature enables users to gather their desired books in one place before proceeding to the checkout process. When books are added or removed from the cart, the availability and number of copies are automatically updated to reflect the changes.

### 6. Backend with MongoDB
The project includes a backend server built with Node.js and MongoDB. It provides APIs for user authentication, book listing, and cart management. The MongoDB database stores user information, book data, and cart details. The backend ensures data consistency and allows for efficient retrieval and modification of information.
